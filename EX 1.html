    <h3 style="font-size: xx-large;"><u>GAMEPLAY</u></h3>
    <p style="font-size: x-large;"><B>The Watch Dogs series is part of a genre known as sandbox games. The series combines elements of action, adventure, stealth and vehicular gameplay. The player can freely roam the virtual world on foot or by use of vehicles and make use of an array of weapon and melee-based combat. Illegal activities such as assaulting non-player characters (NPCs) will instigate a proactive and usually lethal response from authoritative figures. In the instance of death, the player will respawn near the area where they were killed.In each game, the player assumes control of a hacker, who can hack into various electronic devices connected to the fictional ctOS system with their in-game smartphone.[28][29] While most of the abilities granted by ctOS are useful for solving puzzles or in stealth sections, the player can make use of them at almost any given time during gameplay to create different scenarios, such as hacking into the traffic lights to create a traffic jam or calling the police on unsuspecting NPCs. In each game, the player can level up and unlock new hacker abilities and gadgets. In Watch Dogs 2, more weapons and hacker gadgets were introduced, such as a taser and a quadcopter.</B></p>
